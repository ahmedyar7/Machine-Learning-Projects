# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict survivors based on the provided data. The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and building predictive models.

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in data science and machine learning for binary classification problems. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, etc.

## Data

The dataset is available on Kaggle: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes information on passengers such as age, sex, class, and whether they survived.

## Installation
